# DKrypt1337_Bloodhunt
Updated version 2 of the Bloodhunt cheat. I debugged and fixed all of the errors so it works now.

This is an updated version of the original Bloodhunt cheat. As of 2-12-2023, I've fixed and debugged errors where it wasn't working. The problem was hard coded offsets,
instead of referenging the offsets from the file. This caused everything to not work. Currently it is now working though. The bones will need updated though.
